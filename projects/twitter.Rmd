# Aim

The Group Project provides us with a chance to analyse the Social Web
using the knowledge obtained from this unit with assistance from a
computer based statistical package. For this project, we will focus on
[Twitter](http://www.twitter.com).

# Method

To complete this project:

1. Read through this specification

2. Form a group and register your group in the vUWS 300958 Project
   section.

3. Complete the data analysis required by the specification

4. Write up your analysis using your favourite word
   processing/typesetting program, making sure that all of the working
   is shown and that is it presented well.

5. Include the student declaration text on the front page of your
   report. Please make sure that the names and student numbers of each
   group member are clearly displayed on the front page.

6. Submit the report as a PDF by the due date.


# Group Size and Organisation

Students in groups of size 1, 2, or 3 are to work together to complete
this project.  One project report is to be submitted per group.

The group must be formed by signing-up to a group within the Project
section of 300958 in vUWS.  It is not compulsory for all students in a
group to be from the same lab class, but it is generally a good idea.

Groups must be formed by the end of week 9. Once the group is formed,
A `manager' should be nominated from within the group to be
responsible for submitting the report.


# Due date and Submission

The project report is due in by 11:59 p.m. on the Friday of week 12.
The report must be submitted as a PDF file using the assignment
submission facilities in the Project section of 300958 in vUWS.  Only
one student from each group (the manager) needs to submit the
assignment.


# Report Format

Once the required analysis is performed by the group, the members of
the group are to write up the analysis as a report. Remember that the
assessor will only see the groups report and will be marking the
group's analysis based on your report. Therefore the report should
contain a clear and concise description of the procedures carried out,
the analysis of results and any conclusions reached from the analysis.

The required analysis in this specification covers the material
presented in lectures and labs.  Students should use the computer
software R to carry out the required analysis and then present the results
from the analysis in the report.


# Marks

This project is worth 30% of your final grade, and so the project will
be marked out of 30.

When marking the reports, the assessors will adhere to the following
marking criteria:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mark Criteria
----- ---------------------------------------------------------------
   NA Report Not Submitted. Equivalent to 0 when computing final mark.

    0 Report submitted, but incomprehensible.

  1-5 Report contains analysis, but not related to that requested by
      the specification.

 6-10 Report contains some of the analysis requested by the
      specification.

11-15 Report contains most of the analysis requested by the
      specification.

16-20 Report contains all of the analysis requested by the
      specification.

21-25 Report contains all of the analysis requested by the
      specification, with reasonable explanations of why the chosen
      analysis was performed.

26-30 Report contains all of the analysis requested by the
      specification, with reasonable explanations of why the chosen
      analysis was performed.  Further investigation was also
      performed that reduced any uncertainty in the previous analysis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If a report is submitted late, the maximum mark it can achieve will be
reduced by 10% (3 marks) per day. E.g., if a report is submitted five
days late, it can receive at most 15 marks.
