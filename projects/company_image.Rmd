# Aim

The Group Project provides us with a chance to analyse the Social Web
using the knowledge obtained from this unit with assistance from a
computer based statistical package. For this project, we will focus on
identifying a chosen companies Twitter image.

# Method

To complete this project:

1. Read through this specification

2. Form a group and register your group in the vUWS 300958 Project
   section.

3. Choose a company that is active on Twitter and send Laurence an
   email with subject "[300958 Project Company] Name" where Name is
   the name of the company (e.g. if choosing Telstra, the email
   subject would be "[300958 Project Company] Telstra"). Laurence will
   reply to let you know if the company is acceptable. Note that a given
   company cannot be allocated to more than one group.

4. Complete the data analysis required by the specification

5. Write up your analysis using your favourite word
   processing/typesetting program, making sure that all of the working
   is shown and that is it presented well.

6. Include the student declaration text on the front page of your
   report. Please make sure that the names and student numbers of each
   group member are clearly displayed on the front page.

7. Submit the report as a PDF by the due date.


# Group Size and Organisation

Students in groups of size 1, 2, 3 or 4 are to work together to complete
this project.  One project report is to be submitted per group.

The group must be formed by signing-up to a group within the Project
section of 300958 in vUWS.  It is not compulsory for all students in a
group to be from the same lab class, but it is generally a good idea.

Groups must be formed by the end of week 9. Once the group is formed,
A 'manager' should be nominated from within the group to be
responsible for submitting the report.


# Due date and Submission

The project report is due in by 11:59 p.m. on the Friday of week 13.
The report must be submitted as a PDF file using the assignment
submission facilities in the Project section of 300958 in vUWS.  Only
one student from each group (the manager) needs to submit the
assignment.


# Report Format

Once the required analysis is performed by the group, the members of
the group are to write up the analysis as a report. Remember that the
assessor will only see the groups report and will be marking the
group's analysis based on your report. Therefore the report should
contain a clear and concise description of the procedures carried out,
the analysis of results and any conclusions reached from the analysis.

The required analysis in this specification covers the material
presented in lectures and labs.  Students should use the computer
software R to carry out the required analysis and then present the results
from the analysis in the report.


# Marks

## Marks

This project is worth 30% of your final grade, and so the project will
be marked out of 30. The project consists of four investigations
and will be marked using the following criteria:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marks  Criteria Satisfied
-----  -------------------------------------------------------------------
0-5    One of the project parts have been completed correctly.

6-10   Two of the project parts have been completed correctly.

11-15  Three of the project parts have been completed correctly.

16-20  The required work has been completed correctly.

21-25  The required work has been completed correctly and the company questions have been answered based on the results.

26-30  The required work has been completed correctly and the company questions have been answered based on the results of multiple investigations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a report is submitted late, the maximum mark it can achieve will be
reduced by 10% (3 marks) per day. E.g., if a report is submitted five
days late, it can receive at most 15 marks.

# Project Description


A company is investigating its public image and has approached your
team to identify what the public associated with the company name.

1. The company want to obtain an understanding of the general Twitter
community sentiment. Obtain a random sample of tweets (at least 1000)
and report the most representative words of the sample. What do these
words say about the Twitter community?

2. The company wants to identify specifically what the Twitter community is
saying about the company. Identify words that the Twitter public associate to
the company (have the greatest increase in proportion when compared to the
random sample).

3. The company has questioned whether the tweets coming from the Twitter
community are different from the tweets from within the company.  Obtain a set
of tweets from the companies timeline, combine them with the random sample and
the public tweets (from parts 1 and 2) and cluster the set. Identify if the
clusters show that the company tweets are different from the public tweets. 

4. When presenting these results to the committee, you have been asked
to identify any problems with the analytical process used in each part
and how these problems could be corrected. In this section, do not
explain difficulties in writing code or getting programs to
run. Explain how the methods used could lead to misleading results
(e.g. was random sampling used when obtaining the tweets?).

The company want the above analysis to be written up in a professional
report. Each part should have its own section of the report and all
questions should have thoughtful answers. Any code that is used should
be included and clearly explained (include comments in the code).
