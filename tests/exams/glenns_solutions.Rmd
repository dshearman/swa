Setup:
```{r echo=TRUE}
ages = c("13--17","18--24","25--34","35--44","45--54","55--65","65+")
genders = c("F","M")

Provide full marks if quesion is fully answered, or partial marks
using the marks given below.

a. The $\chi^2$ test requires that all cells have a frequency of at
   least 5. For this table, two cells have counts less than 5. (1 mark)

b. The reduced table it computed by summing the merged columns to obtain:

```{r echo=TRUE}
ages = c("13--24","25--34","35--44","45+")
y = x[,c(2,3,4,5)]
y[,1] = apply(x[,c(1,2)],1,sum)
y[,4] = apply(x[,c(5,6,7)],1,sum)
print(y)
```
1 mark for the correct table structure, full marks for the correct table elements.


c. The expected values are computed as $e_{i,j} = {\sum r_{i}c_{j}/\text{total}}$, giving:

```{r echo=TRUE}
gtotal = apply(y,1,sum)
atotal = apply(y,2,sum)
ttotal = sum(y)
e = gtotal %o% atotal/ttotal
print(e)
```

1 mark for providing equation, full marks for correct soltution.

d. The $\chi^2$ test statistic is computed as $\chi^2 = {\sum_{i,j} (o_{i,j} - e_{i,j})^2/e_{i,j}}$
   with degrees of freedom $(r-1)(c-1) = 3$, giving the value $\chi^2$:
```{r echo=TRUE}

print(chisq)
```

correct $\chi^2$, full marks for correct $\chi^2$ and df.



# Question 3

Setup
```{r echo=TRUE}
p = c(0.316, 0.194, 0.169, 0.137, 0.085, 0.073, 0.026)
```

a. The cumulative proportion is simply the sum of the proportions, so the missing values are:
```{r echo=TRUE}
print(cumsum(p)[c(1,4)])
```
Full marks for correct answers, 1 mark if understanding is shown, but answer is wrong.

b. Tweet 1 has 6 words, tweet 2 has 6 words, there is 1 word in
common. Therefore the binary distance between the two tweets is
$(6 + 6 - 2\times 1)/(6 + 6 - 1) = 10/11 = 0.9091$.

Full marks for correct answer, 1 mark for showing understanding.

# Question 6

a. The seasonal cycle is length 4, therefore, the seasonal window is
   length 5, where the ends of the window have weight 0.5.
   For day 1 period 4, the window contains:
```{r echo=TRUE}
x = c(35, 63, 47, 55, 69)
```
   The square root of the values are:
```{r echo=TRUE}
y = sqrt(x)
print(y)
```
   We remove the seasonality using the window:
```{r echo=TRUE}
sum(y * c(0.5, 1, 1, 1, 0.5)/4)
```
   Full marks for correct answer, 1 mark for square root normalisation, 1
   mark for using sliding window, 1 mark for using length 5 window.

b. The seasonal component must sum to zero. We have 3 components, so the fourth component is:
```{r echo=TRUE}
s = c(-0.610, 0.235, 0.541)
-sum(s)
```
Full marks for correct answer, 1 mark for showing understanding.


# Question 7

a. The square root transform is make a Poisson distribution approximately Normal.
   Or Count data would have a variance proportional (equal to) the
   mean. ie non-constant variance. The square root transformation is
   variance stabilising.

1 mark for answer.

b. The contrast for the interaction between company and time is given as $(BC+AI) - (AC+BI)$,
```{r echo=TRUE}
BC = 24.86
AC = 23.92
BI = 29.27
AI = 33.98
contrast = (BC+AI) - (AC+BI)
print(contrast)
```
2 marks for correct answer, or 1 mark for showing understanding.

c. The sum of squares = $\text{constrast}^2/4n$, where $n = 3$.
```{r echo=TRUE}
n = 3
SSI = contrast^2/(4*n)
print(SSI)
```
2 marks for the correct answer, or 1 mark for showing understanding.

```{r echo=TRUE}
SSE = 1.82
MSE = SSE/(4 * (n-1))
print(MSE)
F = SSI/MSE
print(F)
```
Using 1 and $4(n-1) = 8$ degrees of freedom.

3 marks for the correct answer, or 1 mark for MSE, 1 mark for F, 1 mark for DF.
