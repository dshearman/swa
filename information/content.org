* Learning Outcomes

- To understand how we can store and manipulate graphs from social
  networks.


* Topics
- What is a network/social network (nodes, edges, directed, undirected, in degree, out degree)
- Representing networks as a relational matrix

- Measuring similarity between objects (weighted edges)
- Examining the distribution of edges (power law model)


- Clustering (k-means), choosing the right metric

- Storing network data (XML, JSON, YAML  markup)

- Identifying outliers (Items that seem out of place in the network)

- Visualisation of social networks (multi-dimensional scaling?)

- Measuring popularity (Random walk on a graph)
- Identifying hubs (connected to many) and authorities (many connected to).

- Privacy issues.


* Assessment

- Create a family tree in JSON format.
- Write a python script to compute the in-degree, out-degree of a
  network and plot the distribution.
- Compute the popularity of each node by implementing a random walk.
