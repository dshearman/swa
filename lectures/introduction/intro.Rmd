# Social Networks

## What are Social Networks?

Social Networks consist of a set of items and connections showing how each of
the items interact. We can have a social network of:

- a set of students, where a pair of students is connected if they attend the same class,
- a set of cities, where a pair of cities is connected if share a highway,
- a set of programming languages, where a pair is connected if they share a paradigm,
- a set of people, where a pair is connected if they are related.


Social Network Analysis is the analysis of these networks to obtain
information such as which item is the most influential, and if new items
are introduced how does the network change.

## Small World: Six degrees of separation

The theory that two randomly selected people can find a chain of friends
that is at most six in length.

To examine the small world theory an experiment was devised using the
U.S. Postal Service.

## Paul Erd\H{o}s

The small world phenomenon extends to many communities. One of the earliest
examined was the academic research community.

The centre of the research community is thought to be Paul Erd\H{o}s, who
published about 1500 articles with 509 co-authors.

Researchers can measure their centrality with respect to this research
social network by computing their [Erd\H{o}s
number](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/collaborationDistance.html).


## Kevin Bacon

Databases such as the [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/) have allowed us to
examine how connected the set of actors are through the movies they appear
in.

It was thought that the most connected actor was [Kevin
Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Bacon)

The movie distance between any two actors can be computed at the [Oracle of
Bacon](http://oracleofbacon.org/).


# The Social Web

## The World Wide Web

The World Wide Web is a collection of Web pages and databases that are
served from computers spread across the Internet.

The Web was conceived by Tim Berners-Lee as a method a sharing experimental
particle physics results between labs across the world. It was quickly seen
that this platform could be used to serve all kinds of information.

The Web is intrinsically social in that, for it to grow, it requires us to
upload information that others will read.

## Being Social on the Web

As time has passed, higher level applications have been created for social
activity on the Web:

2. Forums: vUWS Discussion Board, Google Groups
3. Bookmarking: Delicious, Pinterest, Reddit, Slashdot
3. Video: YouTube, Vimeo
4. Images: Flickr, Instagram
7. Music: Last.fm
8. Bloging: LiveJournal, WordPress
9. Academic: Mendeley
9. Business: LinkedIn
5. Location: Foursquare
6. MySpace, Facebook, Google+
5. Microblog: Twitter, Vine, Identi.ca, Tumblr
9. Information seeking: StackExchange
