# Accessing Information from the Social Web

## How do I get information from the Web to my program?

## Scraping Web pages


If you can view information in a Web page, then you are able to write
a program to scrape the information into your database.

Scraping data requires knowledge of the HTML structure of the page.

\begin{block}{Example Web page scraping process}

1. Download the HTML from the desired URL
2. Parse the HTML into some data structure
3. Extract the portions at the desired positions (e.g. the first paragraph of the second div block).

\end{block}

The Python library [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) is an example of
software that assists in Web page scraping.


## Problems with Web page scraping

This Python program scrapes the date from the Bureau of Meteorology Web site:

```` {#scrape_temp .python .numberLines startFrom="100"}
import urllib2
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup
bom_url = "http://www.bom.gov.au/nsw/forecasts/sydney.shtml"

# download the HTML
html = urllib2.urlopen(bom_url).read()
# parse HTML
soup = BeautifulSoup(html)
# find the temperature in the HTML
max_temperature = soup.html.body.findAll('em',{"class" : "max"})[0].string
# print the result
print "The maximum temperature for today is " + max_temperature + " degrees."
`````````````````````````````````````````````````

The code is dependent on the formatting of the Web page and so will
break if the formatting changes.


## Parts of a URL

domain
path
parameters

## Accessing an API


Web site provides

An *Application Programming Interface* (API) provides us access to the
information in a structured format, allowing us to use the information
in other applications.

Web sites that provide an API, do so using a specific URL.

\begin{block}{SCEM Seminars site}

- The human readable form: [http://seminars.scem.uws.edu.au/detail.php?id=20]
- The computer readable form using the API: [http://seminars.scem.uws.edu.au/api.php?id=20]

\end{block}

For an API to be effective, it must provide a consistent URL and data
format that allows backward compatibility.


## API data formats

An API should present data in a standard format to allow us to use
existing tools for parsing.

The main formats used are:

- XML
- YAML
- JSON

Each of these formats allow us to represent complex data structures.

## XML

The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is a 


### Use of XML

The Microsoft format .docx is an XML file compressed using Zip.
