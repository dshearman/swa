# Facebook Insights

## Facebook Insights

If you own a facebook page and you have 30 "likes" then you get access to facebook insights.

Facebook believes these Insights are useful - particularly to business.

The School of Computing, Engineering and Mathematics has a facebook page.

## Likes, Reach and Talking About

Facebook Insights records data (over a fixed period) relating to the number of likes, 
the reach and the number "Talking About"

This can be at the *page* or *post* level

* Likes are just the number of unique people who click the *like* button on a page or post. 
* Reach is the number of unique people who might have seen a page or post. It includes likes, but also 
includes people who have seen it because it was *shared* etc.
* "Talking about" means actively interacting with a page or post. 
That is likes, comments, tags or shares etc.

These measures can be obtained for various time periods, daily, weekly, 28-day, as well as a cummulative total.

The measures are only available for pages that 30 or more of that measure.

## Business Questions

The sort of things an organisation might be interested in include.

* What is the Reach of our facebook presence?
* What are the demographics of that Reach --- are we getting to our target audience?
* What impacts have changes to our page/posts/presence made on Reach?

Facebook provide graphical visualisations of this data. We will look at replicating this, and
doing some simple statistical analysis.

## Facebook Insights

The overview screen shows the Reach (and "Talking About") of the Page

The figures at the top are current Likes, and cummulative TA and Reach for the last 7 days.

The graph shows the TA and Reach for 7 day period ending on a particular day, plotted against that day.

The purple circles represent the number of posts each day.

This is all for the past month.

(There is a table of per post info also)

## Facebook Insights

On the second screen (its the same for Likes, Reach or Talking About), the Likes are broken down by several
demographic factors

* Gender, Age, Country, Town, and Language.

The graph is a *bar plot* of proportions by gender and age.

You can choose the time period that this covers, upto a 92 day period.

You can also Export the data for 180 days.


## Export Data

The small button to the right of this second screen allows us to export data.

* Data can be exported at a page or post level.
* Dates can be chosen upto 180 days long.
* XLS or CSV format can be used. XLS contains more information.

We will look at Page level, XLS data.

As exported by Facebook there are sometimes problems with this file,
so open it in Excel and re-save as an XLSX file.

## Export Data
\newcommand\sfont{\fontsize{8}{8.1}\selectfont}

R has some facilities to read XLSX files. The gdata library is one. (This will need to be installed)

```{r, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(gdata, quietly=TRUE)
```
```{r, size='sfont', cache=FALSE}
sheetCount("Facebook Insights Data Export 2013-08-07.xlsx")
sheetNames("Facebook Insights Data Export 2013-08-07.xlsx")
```

## Export Data

The XLSX file contains 65 sheets.
We are primarily going to look at "Key Metrics" and "Weekly Reach by Demographics"

(These are saved as CSV for ease of use, but...)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
keyMetrics <- read.xls("Facebook Insights Data Export 2013-08-07.xlsx", 1)
WeekReach <- read.xls("Facebook Insights Data Export 2013-08-07.xlsx", 34)
```

```{r}
keyMetrics <- read.csv("keyMetrics.csv", as.is=TRUE)
dim(keyMetrics)
WeekReach <- read.csv("WeeklyReachDemog.csv")
dim(WeekReach)
```

The "as.is=TRUE" prevents the key metrics being treated as factors. (see later)

# Reach and Demographics

## Demographics

Demographics refers to the characteristics of individuals. In Facebook, the most useful demographics are Age group and Gender. City, Country and Language are also recorded.

Several sheets in the XLSX file have breakdown by demographics.

We will look at "Weekly Reach Demographics"

## Reach and Demographics
Reading in the CSV file gives the following. At the moment, we are interested in a particular (recent) date.
```{r}
xx <- WeekReach[158,]
print(xx)
```

## Reach and Demographics
First we make this into a table (matrix) after discarding the Date, and "U" categories.
And we set up meaningful row and columns names

```{r, tidy=FALSE}
tab <- matrix(as.numeric(xx[3:16]), nrow=2, byrow=TRUE)
colnames(tab) <- c("13-17", "18-24", "25-34", "35-44", 
                   "45-54", "55-64", "65+")
rownames(tab) <- c("Female","Male")
print(tab)
```

## Reach and Demographics
So we can draw a graph similar to the Facebook one (bar plot)
```{r, echo=2, fig.cap=NULL, dev=c('pdf'), fig.width=5, fig.height=2.8}
par(mar=c(5,4,1,1)+.1, cex=0.7)
barplot(tab, legend=TRUE, col=c("pink","lightblue"))
```

## Reach and Demographics
However, side by side bars are sometimes easier to compare.
```{r, echo=2, tidy=FALSE, fig.cap=NULL, dev=c('pdf'), fig.width=5, fig.height=2.8}
par(mar=c(6,4,0,1)+.1, cex=0.7)
barplot(tab, legend=TRUE, col=c("pink","lightblue"), 
        beside=TRUE)
```

##  Questions of interest.
Business (or page owners) might be interested to know...

* What proportion of Reach is ... eg. Male or 18 to 24? If the page, represents a product or service
you might be interested in whether you are raeching Males more than Females? 
* Is this proportion changing? (see later lecture)
* Are the age *profiles* different for males and females? Is there something different about the age profiles 
that you are reaching?

These are statistical questions...provided we are prepared to assume that the reach is a *random sample* of all possible Reach. (Discuss?)

## Proportions

The simple (point) estimate of the proportion in category XYZ, is simply the number 
in that category divided by the total.

Eg. Number of males  (2+121+31+7+4+2+3)= 170, Number of females (1+45+15+6+2+3+2) =74,
therefore total = 170+74 = 244

proportion 170/244 = 0.697 or 69.7%

## Confidence Interval for Proportion

Revision: A confidence interval is a range that contains the true proportion with high confidence.

For a proportion it takes the form, $\hat{p} \pm \Delta$ where $\Delta = z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})/n}$
where $n$ is the total (and should be large), and $z_{\alpha/2}$ is 
a constant derived from a Normal distribution, that determines the level of confidence.

For a $\alpha=$ 95% confidence interval $z_{\alpha/2} = 1.960$

For a $\alpha=$ 90% confidence interval $z_{\alpha/2} = 1.645$

## Confidence Interval for Proportion

Q. Find a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of males reached.

$\hat{p}= 0.697$, $z_{\alpha/2} = 1.960$, $n=244$

Therefore, $\Delta = z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})/n} = 1.960\times\sqrt{0.697*(1-0.697)/244} = 0.058$

Confidence Interval is $\hat{p}\pm\Delta = 0.697 \pm 0.058$ or $(0.639, 0.755)$


## Confidence Interval for Proportion

In R we can use the prop.test function. It does a hypothesis test, but also computes a confidence interval.
**prop.test(x,n, conf.level)** where x is the count in the category of interest (not the proportion)

```{r}
prop.test(170,244, conf.level=0.95)
```

Results are slightly different due to a different approximation.

## Age profiles

Are the age profiles of the males and females that we are reaching different?
That is, neglecting the the difference in overall number is the spread across ages different?

```{r}
print(tab)
```

Is there evidence, that the age profiles of genders in our audience differs?

This is a *hypothesis test*

## Hypothesis test

Revision: In a hypothesis test we assume a hypothesis that will be accepted by default (null hypothesis), 
and then try and show that the data demonstrates this is unlikely.

In this case, our null hypothesis will be that the age profiles of males and females are the same.
The *alternative hypothesis* is that they are not.

Think of the data as a table (or matrix) with $r$ rows and $c$ columns
called $X$ and denote the entry in the $i$-th row and $j$-th as $X_{ij}$

In our example, $r$ is 2, and $c$ is 7 and $X_{2,2} = 121$ for example.


## Chi-squared test

Firstly, assume the null hypothesis is true. Then we can ignore gender and estimate the proportion in each age group.

The total numbers in each age category are;
```{r, echo=FALSE}
apply(tab,2,sum)
```

So the proportions ($q_j$) are (divide by 244);
```{r, echo=FALSE}
q <- apply(tab,2,sum)/sum(tab)
print(q<-round(q,3))
```

We already know that the proportions in each *row* ($p_i$) are;
```{r, echo=FALSE}
p <- apply(tab,1,sum)/sum(tab)
print(p<-round(p,3))
```

## Chi-squared test

So if the null hypothesis is true, the *expected* proportion in the $ij$-th cell of the table, is just
$p_i \times q_j$. This means the *expected* **number** in that cell is 
$np_iq_j$.

So how different are the observed? We could look at  $(X_{ij} - np_iq_j)^2$.
If this is big then the observed cell counts and expected are different.

Taking all cells into account we have to use a *weighted* sum. 
$$
\chi^2 = \sum_i \sum_j \frac{(X_{ij} - np_iq_j)^2}{np_iq_j}
$$

If this is big then some of the observed cell counts and expected counts are different.

## Chi-squared test

If the observed and expected counts are different then it is likely the null hypothesis is false.

So how big does $\chi^2$ have to be? It depends on the number of rows and columns in the table $X$, 
and how sure you want to be that they are different.

The approximate *critical* values are taken from a $\chi^2$-distribtuion. This is a Chi-squared test!

NOTE: this only works if the expected values are all bigger than about 5.

## Chi-squared distribution.

Suppose you want to make an error, 5% of the time. That is, you will say the age profiles are different 
when they are not really, only 5% of the time. (This is called the significance or $\alpha$)

Then the value that $\chi^2$ has to exceed depends on the size of the table. It depends on the
*degrees of freedom* which in this case is 
$(r-1)\times(c-1)$

```{r, echo=FALSE}
TT <- round(qchisq(0.95, 1:10),3)
names(TT) <- as.character(1:10)
print(TT)
```

Critical values for a $\chi^2$ distribution for degrees of freedom upto 10.

## Summary of chi-squared test

1. Compute the row and column proportions
2. Compute the expected cell counts
3. Compute the squared difference between the observed and expected counts
4. Sum the squared differences using the reciprocal of the expected counts as weights
5. Refer the $\chi^2$ to a critcal value, if exceeds it reject the null hypothesis.

## The Facebook data

The expected counts are
```{r, echo=FALSE}
E <- round(sum(tab)*outer(p,q,"*"),2)
print(E)
```
Some of these are less than 5. We have two options either discard some cells, this changes the hypothesis. 
Or aggregate some cells. 

## The Facebook data

If we change the categories and add up we get
```{r, echo=FALSE}
tab2 <- tab[,2:4]
tab2[,1] <- tab2[,1] + tab[,1]
tab2[,3] <- tab2[,3] + apply(tab[,5:7],1,sum)
colnames(tab2) <- c("<25", "25-34", "35+")
print(tab2)
```
The proportions are now
```{r, echo=FALSE}
q <- round(apply(tab2,2,sum)/sum(tab2),3)
print(q)
print(p)
```

## The Facebook data

Thus the expected counts are (all greater than 5)
```{r, echo=FALSE}
X <- tab2
E <- round(sum(X)*outer(p,q,"*"),2)
print(E)
```

So the Observed minus Expected Squared is
```{r, echo=FALSE}
(X-E)^2
```
And the weighted sum ($\chi^2$) is `r sum((X-E)^2/E)`

This is **not** larger than the critical value of a $\chi^2$ on 2 degrees of freedom (5.991), so we cannot reject the null hypothesis

## The Facebook data in R

Of course R does all of this
```{r}
X <- matrix(c(46, 123, 15, 31, 13, 16), ncol=3)
colnames(X) <- c("<25", "25-34", "35+")
rownames(X) <-  c("Female", "Male")
print(X)
chisq.test(X)
```
The numbers are slightly different (due to rounding this time) and the test returns a *p value*. 

## *p* values

The *p* value is the probability of exceeding the calculated $\chi^2$ under the null hypothesis.

So instead of seeing if the calculated $\chi^2$ is bigger than a critical value, you can check if the p-value is 
less than the significance (5% say --- 0.05)

## The Facebook data in R

It turns out R can handle the "counts less than 5" case also, using *Fisher's exact test*

```{r, echo=2:3}
X <- tab
print(X)
fisher.test(X)
```

Fisher's exact test is generally not done by hand.

# Key Metrics

## Key Metrics
The Key Metrics data has a header row, and a second row that is a description. There are 90 columns: 1,15,18 and 24 are;

* **Date** The Date! 
* **Daily Total Reach** Daily The number of people 
who have seen any content associated with your Page. (Unique Users)
* **Daily Organic Reach** Daily The number of people who visited your Page, or saw your Page or one of its posts in News Feed or ticker. These can be people who have liked your Page and people who haven't. (Unique Users)
* **Daily Viral Reach** Daily The number of people who saw your Page or one of its posts from a story shared by a Friend. These stories include liking your Page, posting to your Page's Timeline, liking, commenting on or sharing one of your Page posts, answering a question you posted, responding to one of your events, mentioning your Page, tagging your Page in a photo or checking in at your location. (Unique Users)

## Key Metrics
```{r}
dates <- keyMetrics[,1]
dates <- dates[-1]
dates <- strptime(dates, format="%m/%d/%y")
reach <- keyMetrics[,15]
reach[1]
reach <- as.numeric(reach[-1])
```

## Key Metrics
```{r, fig.cap="Daily Total Reach", dev=c('pdf'), fig.width=4, fig.height=2.8, echo=2}
par(mar=c(4,4,0,1)+0.1, cex=0.7)
plot(dates, reach, type="l")
```

## Key Metrics
```{r, fig.cap="Daily Total Reach", dev=c('pdf'), fig.width=4, fig.height=2.8, echo=2:3}
par(mar=c(4,4,0,1)+0.1, cex=0.7)
keep <- (dates > as.POSIXlt("2013-07-01"))
plot(dates[keep], reach[keep], type="l")
```

## Weekly Total Reach
```{r, fig.cap="Weekly Total Reach", dev=c('pdf'), fig.width=4, fig.height=2.8, echo=2:3}
par(mar=c(4,4,0,1)+0.1, cex=0.7)
wreach <- as.numeric(keyMetrics[-1,16])
plot(dates[keep], wreach[keep], type="l")
```

## Conclusion

So by exporting the data we can do a lot more than the usual insights provide

* Testing of Reach demographics
* Estimating features of Reach/Likes etc
* Graphing different parameters
* Graphing over different time periods
