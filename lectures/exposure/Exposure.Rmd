## Facebook Insights

If you own a facebook page and you have 30 "likes" then you get access to facebook insights.

Facebook believes these Insights are useful - particularly to business.

The School of Computing, Engineering and Mathematics has a facebook page.


## Likes, Reach and Talking About

Facebook Insights records data (over a fixed period) relating to the number of likes, 
the reach and the number "Talking About"

This can be at the *page* or *post* level

* Likes are just the number of unique people who click the *like* button on a page or post. 
* Reach is the number of unique people who might have seen a page or post. It includes likes, but also 
includes people who have seen it because it was *shared* etc.
* "Talking about" means actively interacting with a page or post. 
That is likes, comments, tags or shares etc.

These measures can be obtained for various time periods, daily, weekly, 28-day, as well as a cummulative total.

The measures are only available for pages that 30 or more of that measure.

## Business Questions

The sort of things an organisation might be interested in include.

* What is the Reach of our facebook presence?
* What are the demographics of that Reach --- are we getting to our target audience?
* What impacts have changes to our page/posts/presence made on Reach?

Facebook provide graphical visualisations of this data. We will look at replicating this, and
doing some simple statistical analysis.

The overview screen shows the Reach (and "Talking About") of the Page

The figures at the top are current Likes, and cummulative TA and Reach for the last 7 days.

The graph shows the TA and Reach for 7 day period ending on a particular day, plotted against that day.

The purple circles represent the number of posts each day.

This is all for the past month.

(There is a table of per post info also)

On the second screen (its the same for Likes, Reach or Talking About), the Likes are broken down by several
demographic factors

* Gender, Age, Country, Town, and Language.

The graph is a *bar plot* of proportions by gender and age.

You can choose the time period that this covers, upto a 92 day period.

You can also Export the data for 180 days.
