# Sentiment

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis>


# Sentiment Analysis

Classifying the polarity of a piece of text (positive, neutral or
negative).

Advanced sentiment analysis examines the emotion behind the text
(e.g. excited, annoyed, surprised).






# Classification of Sentiment


It is difficult to identify what part of text sets the sentiment.

Therefore to perform sentiment analysis, we will use a machine
learning to learn from a set of examples and automatically classify
new pieces of text.

Machine learning methods require a set of objects each with a set of
measured features and a class.  We want to examine the features and
make a prediction of the class.  To do this, we obtain many examples
of objects with their classes and learn the relationships between
them.
