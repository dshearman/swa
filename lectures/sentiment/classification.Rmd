# Sentiment Analysis

Classifying the polarity of a piece of text (positive, neutral or
negative).

Advanced sentiment analysis examines the emotion behind the text
(e.g. excited, annoyed, surprised).



## Classification

Classification is the task of assigning a class (category) to an
object based on its attributes (variables, features).

Classification is a similar task to regression, but regression
predicts a real value for each object.

### Example

Classification:
$$
	[~0.3~1.2~-4.3~2~] \rightarrow \text{Spam}
$$
Regression:
$$
	[~0.3~1.2~-4.3~2~] \rightarrow 4.4
$$

## Binary Classification

Classification is to assign a class to an object. Binary
classification is assigning a class to an object where there are only
two classes to choose from. Binary classification is the most common
form of classification, since it is less complex than multi-class
classification, and it allows us to predict answers to Yes/No
(True/False) questions.

### Example

If we want to classify if an email is spam, we would construct a
classifier that takes attributes of an email as its parameters, and
returns True or False:
$$
	\text{is.spam}(\text{email}) \rightarrow \{True, False\}
$$

# Classification of Sentiment


It is difficult to identify what part of text sets the sentiment.

Therefore to perform sentiment analysis, we will use a machine
learning to learn from a set of examples and automatically classify
new pieces of text.

Machine learning methods require a set of objects each with a set of
measured features and a class.  We want to examine the features and
make a prediction of the class.  To do this, we obtain many examples
of objects with their classes and learn the relationships between
them.
